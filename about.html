      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p><strong>Welcome to my corner of the web!</strong> I'm Jotipriya Das, a PhD scholar in Data Science at IIT Palakkad, driven by a deep fascination with transforming raw data into actionable insights and innovative solutions. My journey, which began in Katwa and brought me up in Barasat, West Bengal, has been a vibrant blend of academic pursuit, personal passions, and a continuous quest for knowledge.</p>

      <h2>üéì My Academic Journey: From Mathematics to Data Science</h2>

      <p>My educational path has been defined by a love for logic and problem-solving, particularly in mathematics. I completed my schooling up to Class 10 at Ramakrishna Vivekananda Mission Vidyabhavan, Barrackpore, where I secured 79.28% in my Madhyamik Exam under the West Bengal Board of Secondary Education.</p>

      <p>For my higher secondary education, I attended Purba Barasat Adarsha Bidyapeeth, Barasat, focusing on the Science stream with a subject combination of Bengali, English, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biological Sciences. My dedication paid off in the Higher Secondary Exam under the West Bengal Council of Higher Secondary Education, where I achieved 84%, notably securing full marks in Mathematics. This success, coupled with my inherent love for the subject, naturally led me to pursue a Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) in Mathematics.</p>

      <p>I was fortunate to gain admission to both Jadavpur University and Presidency University for my B.Sc. in Mathematics. Choosing Presidency University was a decision I cherish deeply. Its beautiful campus, with its white buildings and British architecture, provided an inspiring backdrop for my studies. The years spent there were unforgettable, filled with enriching cultural functions at Portico, lively sports events in Presi Greens, countless hours spent with friends chilling at Tank, dancing in Derozio Hall, and the memorable sleepless nights after the main events of MILIEU, the university's primary function. My B.Sc. truly felt like it was done in the blink of an eye.</p>

      <p>After building such strong bonds and experiences at Presidency, adapting to a new environment was a challenge, but I embraced it. I moved to the University of Kalyani to pursue my Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Data Science. Over two years, I immersed myself in the intricacies of data, preparing for the next phase of my career.</p>

      <p>Now, I'm thrilled to embark on a new chapter, having received an offer letter from IIT Palakkad, Kerala, to pursue my PhD in Data Science. This marks the beginning of an exciting new journey, pushing the boundaries of my knowledge and contributing to the evolving landscape of data science.</p>

      <h2>üèè Beyond Academics: Passions and Pursuits</h2>

      <p>While academia and research are central to my life, I believe in a well-rounded existence. I'm an enthusiastic sportsperson, enjoying Cricket, Football, Volleyball, and Carrom. In my teenage years, I even pursued cricket professionally, which taught me invaluable lessons in discipline, teamwork, and resilience.</p>

      <p>Away from the data models and sports fields, I also find immense joy in playing the guitar. It's a wonderful way to unwind, express creativity, and connect with a different side of myself.</p>

      <h2>üöÄ What's Next?</h2>

      <p>As I embark on my PhD journey at IIT Palakkad, I am eager to delve deeper into specialized areas within Data Science, contribute to meaningful research, and continue to grow both intellectually and personally. This website will serve as a platform to share my ongoing research, projects, and insights.</p>

      <p><em>Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy exploring my work!</em></p>
